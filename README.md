I'm a product-UX-focused full-stack developer based in Vancouver, Canada 🇨🇦. 

### What I'm currently into (Feb, 2023)
1. Design System: Creating design systems with good old CSS🎨
2. Applied AI: Integration of generative AI with design systems 👩🏽‍🎨 or integration between ChatGPT and traditional APIs in general.
3. Cloud🌤️ Native: Such as building a universal YAML scripting language that can be used in cloud native environment check out [YAMAS](https://github.com/the-watchmaker/typingbrain) and a Pprometheus exporter builder app using YAMAS🗻
4. Decentralized Apps: 📡 Interconnected desktop apps using Tauri and Electron as UI and some experimental distributed computing stuff.


### Generative AI is the new MSG for your app now
