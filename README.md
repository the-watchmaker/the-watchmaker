Spent some quality time with my fam in Jan and Feb. <br />
Embarking on some new exciting projects. <br />

### What I'm currently into (Mar, 2023)
1. 🎨 Design Systems with good old CSS + ChatGPT [mood-css-gpt - WIP](https://github.com/the-watchmaker/mood-css-gpt)
2. 👩🏽‍🎨 Applied AI: Mostly ChatGPT integration with legacy APIs [Arathia Saga - ChatGPT novel](https://github.com/the-watchmaker/arathia-saga-chatgpt)
3. 🌤️ Cloud Native stuff. [Terrari - WIP](https://github.com/the-watchmaker/terrari) and [YAMAS](https://github.com/the-watchmaker/yamas)
4. 📡 Desktop apps or dApps. [TypingBrain](https://github.com/the-watchmaker/typingbrain) 
5. 🤪 dbt, data stack and BI stuff. Accidentally got into it. Just finished a bootcamp on Udemy. 

### New Pet Projects
1. [TypingBrain - working Alpha](https://github.com/the-watchmaker/typingbrain): learning/retaining language syntax just by typing. 
2. [YAMAS - WIP](https://github.com/the-watchmaker/yamas): A YAML Scripting language that can be run on CLI and libs to mutate itself for some useful stuff
3. [Terrari - WIP](https://github.com/the-watchmaker/terrari): Tiny lightweight desktop app that manages your cloud resources
4. [mood-css-gpt - WIP](https://github.com/the-watchmaker/mood-css-gpt): An experiment that captures emotions from a text and translate them into CSS using ChatGPT


### Generative AI is the new MSG for your app now
