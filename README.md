### 🔥 Hot Open Source Projects You Should Star ⭐️
1. ⭐️ [Lightdash](https://github.com/lightdash/lightdash) Super awesome easy-to-use open-source BI platform. I'm interested in its data visualization, business logics around dbt and the data stacks, also opportunity to interact and learn from data analyst stakeholders within its growing community.
2. ⭐️ [PRQL](https://github.com/prql/prql) SQL replacer that comes with data transform and purposed for data pipeline. I'm intersted in their language design, and the compiler written in Rust for a good read.

### My New Pet Projects
