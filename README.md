### What I'm currently into (Mar, 2023)
1. Product Design: Started my junior journey towards product design
2. Design System: Creating design systems with good old CSS🎨
3. Applied AI: Integration of generative AI with design systems 👩🏽‍🎨 and integration between ChatGPT and traditional APIs in general.
4. Cloud🌤️ Native: Such as building a universal YAML scripting language that can be used in cloud native environment check out [YAMAS](https://github.com/the-watchmaker/typingbrain) and a Pprometheus exporter builder app using YAMAS🗻
5. Decentralized Apps: 📡 Interconnected desktop apps using Tauri and Electron as UI and some experimental distributed computing stuff.

### Pet Projects
1. [TypingBrain](https://github.com/the-watchmaker/typingbrain): learning/retaining language syntax just by typing. 
2. [YAMAS](https://github.com/the-watchmaker/yamas): A YAML Scripting language that can be run on CLI and libs to mutate itself for some useful stuff
3. YAMAS-UI: a GUI to turn YAMAS into a visual programming language (upcoming up...)
4. Exporter Bulider: Using YAMAS-UI, you can now create whatever Prometheus exporter you desire (upcoming up...)

### Generative AI is the new MSG for your app now
