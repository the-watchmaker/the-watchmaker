### Hi, I'm Ryan Lee

I'm a product-UX-focused full-stack developer based in Vancouver, Canada 🇨🇦. I'm trying to become a product designer at the moment. This repo is solely for my "personal" tech interests.


### What I'm currently into these days (Feb, 2023)
1. Creating design systems with good old CSS🎨
2. Integration of generative AI with design systems 👩🏽‍🎨 (or integration between ChatGPT and traditional APIs in general)
3. Cloud🌤️ Native stuff such as building a universal YAML scripting language that can be used in cloud native environment check out [YAMAS](https://github.com/the-watchmaker/typingbrain) 
4. Prometheus exporter builder app using YAMAS🗻
5. 📡 Interconnected desktop apps using Tauri and Electron as UI and some experimental distributed computing stuff.


### Generative AI is the new MSG for your app now
